	Cake and Bake Shop started as a project for Software Engineering class at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in fall 2018 without experience or having baked a cake ever. Three ambitious students hungry for Ruby on Rails knowledge. </br></br>

	We are a small town in deep south Texas, right where you start thinking you exited the country without actually leaving. Our business has a strong background in conchas, donuts, empanadas, and pecan pie, and party planning (aka BBQ). We are very much inspired by our grandparents culture, great design and flavors, gorgeous colors, and classic patterns. Our goal is to sell products we love to eat, create a workplace to not just sell but bring families, and friends together, and inspire our customers to celebrate along with those they love. We love to be that bridge connecting people, reminding them what is really important. </br></br>
